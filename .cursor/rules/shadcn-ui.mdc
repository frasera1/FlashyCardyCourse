# shadcn/ui Component Library

This project uses **shadcn/ui** for all UI elements and components.

## Initialization

If shadcn/ui is not yet initialized in the project, run the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

This will:

- Create a `components.json` configuration file
- Set up the necessary directory structure (typically `src/components/ui/`)
- Configure Tailwind CSS for shadcn/ui components
- Install required dependencies

## Usage Guidelines

1. **All UI components must use shadcn/ui**: When creating or modifying UI elements, use shadcn/ui components instead of creating custom components from scratch.

2. **Installing Components**: If a particular component is not installed, you MUST install it before using it. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
   ```

   For example, to install the button component:

   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest add button
   ```

   Always check if a component exists in `src/components/ui/` before using it. If it doesn't exist, run the installation command first.

3. **Component Location**: shadcn/ui components are typically located in `src/components/ui/` directory.

4. **Customization**: shadcn/ui components are copied into your project, so you can customize them directly. However, prefer using the component's built-in props and variants before modifying the source code.

5. **Styling**: Components use Tailwind CSS v4 and follow the project's design system. Use the `@theme` directive in [globals.css](mdc:src/app/globals.css) for design tokens.

6. **TypeScript**: All shadcn/ui components are fully typed. Import types when extending or wrapping components.
